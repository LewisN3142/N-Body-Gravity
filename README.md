## About

This project allows for the computation of acceleration of objects within many object systems, given the masses and positions of said objects in a `.csv` file. The code has been designed using functional programming paradigms, such that the end-user may easily add functions to compute additional derived quantities. The contents of this repository were developed as part of an interview assessment for the role of Scientific Software Engineer at the Met Office, UK and may be made private at their request.

## Acknowledgements and References

I would like to thank the staff at the Met Office for inviting me to interview and setting the exercise that led to me producing this programme. The experience of diving back into python and solving this problem, while keeping in mind software engineering principles such as unit testing, versioning, and modularity was a great way to learn and consolidate my knowledge.

The references below were particularly useful in my research &mdash; I recommend reading these for more context on the problem itself, especially the Barnes&ndash;Hut algorithm:
