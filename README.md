## About

This project allows for the computation of acceleration of objects within many object systems, given the masses and positions of said objects in a `.csv` file. The code has been designed using functional programming paradigms, such that the end-user may easily add functions to compute additional derived quantities. The contents of this repository were developed as part of an interview assessment for the role of Scientific Software Engineer at the Met Office, UK and may be made private at their request.
